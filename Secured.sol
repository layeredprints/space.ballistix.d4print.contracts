/**
 * Parent contract that wraps the Users contract to verify function calls via modifiers
 *
 * note: can be dangerous if used incorrectly, malicious users contract could be referenced
 * may need to change architecture or remove usage of this altogether
 *
 * A constructor like so:
 * constructor (address usersContractAddres) public Secured(usersContractAddres)
 *
 * means that the Secured contract instance will wrap whatever user contract address is passed,
 * the msg.sender that is passed implicitly through the Secured constructor
 * will be verified as a permitted caller through an extension of the Delegate contract in the Users contract
 * this will happen on each function call
 *
 * this also means that whatever contract that extends the Secured contract, has to be registered as
 * a permitted caller of the referenced Users contract to be able to use its [the Secured contract] modifiers
